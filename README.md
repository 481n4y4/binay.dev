## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

* Node.js (preferably latest LTS version)
* npm or yarn package manager

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/481n4y4/binay.dev.git
cd binay.dev
npm install
# or if using yarn
# yarn install
```

---

## Development

To start the developer server with live reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

This will spin up a local server (by default at `http://localhost:5173`) and watch for changes.

---

## Build and Deployment

To build the production version:

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

This produces optimized and minified static files in the `dist` folder (or as configured in Vite).

You can deploy the contents of `dist` to any static hosting platform. For example, Vercel is already being used in this project.

---

## Configuration

Some relevant config files in the project:

* `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration
* `.eslint.config.js` — ESLint rules
* `package.json` — Dependencies and scripts

You may customize these as needed (e.g. add TypeScript, change ESLint rules, etc.)
